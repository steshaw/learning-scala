Tony motivates his introduction of the State monad by looking a tree numbering problem. My first instinct would be to implement
this imperatively (TreeNumberImperativeStyle.scala) but that doesn't help understand the state monad :). TreeNumber.scala is
the solution solved "long hand" but in a functional style. It's equivalent to Tony's solution but easier for me to understand (I
make use of a couple of intermediate vals in the number function).

Currently in all sorts of bother with the TreeNumberWithStateMonad.scala version. I'm not compiling against Scalaz. I wanted
to try to use the State trait myself and implement the init and modify functions. Well, it doesn't even compile at the moment...

// =========================================================================

// Note, it's not required for you to define these three settings. These are
// mostly only necessary if you intend to publish your library's binaries on a
// place like Sonatype or Bintray.


// Want to use a published library in your project?
// You can define other libraries as dependencies in your build like this:

libraryDependencies +=
  "org.scala-lang.modules" %% "scala-parser-combinators" % "1.1.2"
libraryDependencies +=
  "org.scala-lang.modules" %% "scala-parser-combinators" % "1.1.2"
libraryDependencies +=
  "org.scala-lang" % "scala-reflect" % scalaVersion.value


// You can use Scaladex, an index of all known published Scala libraries. There,
// after you find the library you want, you can just copy/paste the dependency
// information that you need into your build file. For example, on the
// scala/scala-parser-combinators Scaladex page,
// https://index.scala-lang.org/scala/scala-parser-combinators, you can copy/paste
// the sbt dependency from the sbt box on the right-hand side of the screen.

// IMPORTANT NOTE: while build files look _kind of_ like regular Scala, it's
// important to note that syntax in *.sbt files doesn't always behave like
// regular Scala. For example, notice in this build file that it's not required
// to put our settings into an enclosing object or class. Always remember that
// sbt is a bit different, semantically, than vanilla Scala.

// ============================================================================

// Most moderately interesting Scala projects don't make use of the very simple
// build file style (called "bare style") used in this build.sbt file. Most
// intermediate Scala projects make use of so-called "multi-project" builds. A
// multi-project build makes it possible to have different folders which sbt can
// be configured differently for. That is, you may wish to have different
// dependencies or different testing frameworks defined for different parts of
// your codebase. Multi-project builds make this possible.

// Here's a quick glimpse of what a multi-project build looks like for this
// build, with only one "subproject" defined, called `root`:

// lazy val root = (project in file(".")).
//   settings(
//     inThisBuild(List(
//       organization := "ch.epfl.scala",
//       scalaVersion := "2.13.3"
//     )),
//     name := "hello-world"
//   )
